## Website requirements

* A typical product page looks like this - https://kurianinc.us/?page_id=1839 It needs to be migrated in the format https://kurianinc.us/aws-machine-images/apache-web-server/ A temp name could be used first with the assumption that renaming of related file in GitHub later would enough to retain this mapping.
* Pick a suitable Jekyll theme. No preference.
