# kurianinc

## Website requirements

* The current site is at http://kurianinc.us/ That needs to be moved to Gethub Pages using this repository.
* A typical product page looks like this - https://kurianinc.us/?page_id=1839 It needs to be migrated in the format https://kurianinc.us/aws-machine-images/apache-web-server/ A temp name could be used first with the assumption that renaming of related file in GitHub later would enough to retain this mapping.
* Pick a suitable Jekyll theme. No preference.
* There is no one-to-one migration except for the product and service pages. The objctive is to have simpler, professional website that suits our small business in cloud computing.

## Vendor requirements
* You have experience building professional websites using GitHub Pages.
* Github account that can be used to checkin the code.

## Your response would include:
* Experience building Github Pages based websites.

## Deliverables

 * Index page: https://kurianinc.us/?page_id=1680 Sample detail page: https://kurianinc.us/?page_id=1865
 * https://kurianinc.us/?page_id=2563 (only a link needed from index page, no detailed page)
