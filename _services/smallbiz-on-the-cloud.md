# SmallBiz on the Cloud

The core services needed for running a small business such as website, email and support ticketing system, are run in a public cloud platform like AWS. This helps a growing business to scale those services as the business grows and there is no need to subscribe any such services upfront.

If you need a starter professional website complete with a support ticketing tool for your business send the requirements to contact@kurianinc.us.
